## My Backend Journey

I started this journey to deepen my understanding of backend development. Here's a breakdown of the learning path:

### 1. **Basic Backend Code**
   - Understanding the fundamentals of backend programming.
   - Setting up a server and working with basic APIs.

### 2. **Connecting Backend with Frontend**
   - Learning how to integrate a backend server with a frontend application.
   - Building end-to-end solutions for web applications.

### 3. **Data Modeling**
   - Exploring the principles of designing database schemas.
   - Learning to organize and structure data effectively.

### 4. **MongoDB Basics**
   - Getting started with MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
   - Learning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and database integration.

### 5. **Backend Project**
   - Applying everything I learned to create a complete backend project.
   - Facing real-world challenges and implementing practical solutions.
